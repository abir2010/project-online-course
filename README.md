# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Learn & Grow Online Course

This is a demo project, based on online course management system.

### Create a folder (example : my-app)

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

use this command to start the server (http://localhost:5173/),

    Make sure to have stable internet connection, because I used some resources from internet (images).
    I have used Tailwind CSS for my shortage of time, otherwise i would've used raw CSS to style components.(Please make consideration in that occasion)

This Project is based on a demo online course management single page application ,

    There are 8(eight) sections with Header and Footer
    React JS is used to create this SPA
    Tailwind CSS is used to design React components
    For State management there is Context API
    And local data was kept in Public folder in JSON file

```
Thank You
```
